# Wave Portal Smart Contract

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. I went forth and created a sample project, then deleted default contract, test and scripts. Then I build a new contract for the portal, created the run.js and deploy.js files. Then deployed on a node within hardhat. 

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
